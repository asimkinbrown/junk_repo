#number of umis to include for each mip/sample combo. This keeps massively over-
#sequenced stuff from bogging down the analysis. 20000 is default.
downsample_umi_count: 20000

#when umis are randomly chosen, this random seed allows you to make sure the
#same random seeds get chosen when re-running a sample (or you could change the
#number to see if results are robust when different random umis are chosen)
downsample_seed: 312

#how many CPUs (or threads) to use in parallel - you can set this relatively low
#(e.g. 10) because most of the intensive steps of this program are parallelized
#across samples (i.e. 1000 parallel processes if you have 1,000 samples).
cpu_count: 10

#This applies to the most memory intensive steps of the pipeline. Lower values
#complete faster on a cluster but may crash out for bigger samples or highly
#sampled mips. Higher values complete slower but are less likely to crash. For
#the best of both worlds, you can set a low initial value, run all steps that
#complete, and then set a higher value and rerun to tackle any remaining failed
#steps. 4000 is a good minimum, 200000 is a good maximum, 20000 is medium.
